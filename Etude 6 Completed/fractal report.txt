Fractal Report - Oliver Westenra

Writing the recursive program was a lot simpler than the iterative because 
you can just have a drawSquares function that draws the squares and call
it on each of the squares. Iterative method is a lot more complex and took
a lot longer to write. I calculated the measurements for each square and
added it to an array and then take the first square off the array and add
the coordinates for its surrounding squares to the array. 
Recursive is better, iterative sucks.
